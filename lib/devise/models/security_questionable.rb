    # SecurityQuestionable is responsible for validating a user's security question and answer
    # during authentication or password recovery processes.
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # SecurityQuestionable adds the following options to devise:
    #
    #   * +security_question_count+: The number of security questions to require.
    #   * +security_answer_attempts+: The number of times a user can attempt to answer security questions before lock.
    #   * +min_security_question_age+: The time period within which a user should have answered security questions.
    #     After this time passes, they will be asked to answer questions again. Defaults to 6.hours.
